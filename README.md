# hue-workflow

A very basic gulp workflow. 

## Features:

* Uglifying JS
* Minifying CSS
* Auto reload server

## Usage

Put any files in the corresponding directories.
HTML files go into the _templates_ dir.

```gulp``` runs all tasks without starting the server.

```gulp dev``` runs all tasks and starts the reload server.
